# AI Security & Machine Learning Projects

A collection of high-impact projects at the intersection of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.

## Featured Project: AI Phishing URL Detector
Developed an end-to-end classifier that detects zero-day phishing attacks by analyzing lexical URL structures with **96% accuracy**.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- **Deployment:** Streamlit (Web UI), Google Colab
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier

### Key Insights
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted 54 unique features, including URL entropy and SSL metadata.
- **Top Indicator:** Found that `URLSimilarityIndex` and `DomainRegistrationLength` were the strongest predictors of malicious intent.
